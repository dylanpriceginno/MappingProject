# Mapping Project
A piece of work requested by Facility team for a simple dashboard which would replace the excel model they had built. Below are 4 Pages of the 20 page report. Data included is dummy data. 

Page 1 - A simple navigation page with buttons linked to specified pages. Pages will also have security attached to ensure only those with the correct credentials can access them.
